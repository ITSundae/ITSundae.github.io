    <p>Ethical Hacking, Python, Synthwave, and Writeups. Coming to a website near you! I operate on a timescale of "when it's done." So I'm just not going to post an estimated due date. Come back later.

    Please come back later.</p>

#header: the website title (creative title here)
#Subtitle: "Ethical Hacking, Python, Synthwave, and Writeups."
#navigation bar: Index -> About -> Legal -> Writeups
#main body: lorem itsum this is a website that is obnoxiously linked to GitHub but it's cool because making updates is really easy.
#Useless comment
#Fluid scaling. It's beautiful. It does nice things.
#Mobile compatibility is hard.
